/**
 * Example: Using CDN-hosted samples
 * 
 * To use a CDN URL, simply replace the sampleUrl with a full URL:
 * 
 * {
 *     id: 'grandPiano',
 *     name: 'Grand Piano',
 *     sampleUrl: 'https://cdn.example.com/piano-c4.wav',
 *     description: 'CDN-hosted grand piano'
 * }
 * 
 * Popular free CDN options:
 * - GitHub Releases (host your sample in a repo)
 * - jsDelivr CDN
 * - Cloudflare R2 (free tier)
 * - AWS S3 (with public access)
 * 
 * Make sure the URL:
 * - Allows CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)
 * - Serves the file with correct Content-Type (audio/wav)
 * - Is accessible without authentication
